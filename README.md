# TI-Scripts
A garbage bin for scripts made on a calculator during math class... Please excuse the hacky-ness of the code, it wasn't meant to be pretty.
# Current Garbage
### BF
A Brainf\*\*ck interpreter... God help us all. Be gentle with it, it's slow.
### BUBBLE
A generic bubble sort implementation. Sorts L1 from least to greatest value.
### FACTOR
A simple factorer that can handle decently sized numbers in an efficient fashion. Stores calculated values synchronously in L1 and L2.
### QUAD
The classic quadratic equation solver.
### REVLIST
Allows for in-place list reversal of L1.
### TICTACTO
Not made by me, but still a pretty neat (and broken) version of the game. Found at http://tibasicdev.wikidot.com/tic-tac-to
### WINDOW
Resizes the graph window to a user-provided value and changes the scale to 1/10th of said value.
